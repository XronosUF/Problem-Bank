Does the function $6 \, x^{2} + 18 \, x + 12$ satisfy the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) over the interval $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}]$?

\input{Derivative-Compute-0052.HELP.tex}

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{No, the function is not continuous over the closed interval $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}]$}
\choice{No, the function is not differentiable over the open interval $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}]$}
\choice{No, the function is not defined over the interval $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}]$}
\choice[correct]{Yes, all the conditions are met}
\end{multipleChoice}

If the conditions are met, then find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of the MVT over the interval $[-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}]$.  If the conditions are not met, then write ``NONE.''

\[c = \answer{-\frac{3}{2}}\]
