\input{Derivative-Compute-0066.HELP.tex}
A baseball pitcher is practicing out on the field with a partner. He releases the ball at shoulder level which is $48$ inches and his partner catches the ball at the height of $62$ inches. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[-16 \, t^{2} + 43 \, t + 48\]

At what time does the partner catch the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{5323}{3}} + \frac{43}{32}}$ seconds.

\input{Derivative-Compute-0066.HELP.tex}
A baseball pitcher is practicing out on the field with a partner. He releases the ball at shoulder level which is $49$ inches and his partner catches the ball at the height of $50$ inches. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[-16 \, t^{2} + 55 \, t + 49\]

At what time does the partner catch the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{9059}{3}} + \frac{55}{32}}$ seconds.
