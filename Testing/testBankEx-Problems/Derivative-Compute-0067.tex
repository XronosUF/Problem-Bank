\begin{problem}
\input{Derivative-Compute-0067.HELP.tex}
A baseball pitcher and batter are practicing out on the field. The pitcher releases the ball at shoulder level which is $50$ inches. The batter hits the ball when it is at a height of $43$. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[-16 \, t^{2} + 45 \, t + 50 \]

At what time does the batter hit the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{6187}{3}} + \frac{45}{32}}$ seconds.

After the ball is struck the height of the ball is modeled by the function

\[-16 \, t^{2} + 55 \, t + 43\]

When does the ball hit the ground (after the batter strikes it)? $t = \answer[tolerance=0.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{6763}{3}} + \frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{6187}{3}} + \frac{45}{16}}$ seconds.

A baseball pitcher and batter are practicing out on the field. The pitcher releases the ball at shoulder level which is $58$ inches. The batter hits the ball when it is at a height of $29$. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[-16 \, t^{2} + 53 \, t + 58 \]

At what time does the batter hit the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{8891}{3}} + \frac{53}{32}}$ seconds.

After the ball is struck the height of the ball is modeled by the function
