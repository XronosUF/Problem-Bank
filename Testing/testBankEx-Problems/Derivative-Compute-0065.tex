\input{Derivative-Compute-0065.HELP.tex}
A baseball pitcher is practicing out on the field. He releases the ball at shoulder level which is $49$ inches. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[-16 \, t^{2} + 60 \, t + 49\]

At what time does the ball hit the ground? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{8} \, \sqrt{421} + \frac{15}{8}}$ seconds.
