Does the function ${2 \, x^{2} + 2 \, x - 4}$ satisfy the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) over the interval $[-1,1]$?

\input{2311-Compute-Derivative-0052.HELP.tex}

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice No, the function is not continuous over the closed interval $[-1,1]$
\choice No, the function is not differentiable over the open interval $(-1,1)$
\choice No, the function is not defined over the interval $[-1,1]$
\choice[correct] Yes, all the conditions are met
\end{multipleChoice}

If the conditions are met, then find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of the MVT.  If the conditions are not met, then write ``NONE.''
