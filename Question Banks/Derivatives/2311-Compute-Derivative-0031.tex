\begin{problem}

A road running north to south crosses a road going east to west at the point $P$.  Cyclist $A$ is riding north along the first road, and cyclist $B$ is riding east along the second road.  At a particular time, cyclist $A$ is $3$ kilometers to the north of $P$ and traveling at ${28}$ kph, while cyclist $B$ is $4$ kilometers to the east of $P$ and traveling at ${21}$ kph.  How fast is the distance between the two cyclists changing? \\[0.5in]

\input{2311_Compute_Derivative_0031.HELP.tex}

The distance between the two cyclists is increasing by $\answer{\frac{168}{5}}$ kph.
