\begin{problem}
\input{Derivative-Compute-0067.HELP.tex}
A baseball pitcher and batter are practicing out on the field. The pitcher releases the ball at shoulder level which is ${53}$ inches. The batter hits the ball when it is at a height of ${49}$. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[
{-16 \, t^{2} + 46 \, t + 53} 
\]

At what time does the batter hit the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{16} \, \sqrt{\frac{1603}{3}} + \frac{23}{16}}$ seconds.

After the ball is struck the height of the ball is modeled by the function

\[
{-16 \, t^{2} + 57 \, t + 49}
\]

When does the ball hit the ground (after the batter strikes it)? $t = \answer[tolerance=0.2]{\frac{1}{16} \, \sqrt{\frac{1783}{3}} + \frac{1}{16} \, \sqrt{\frac{1603}{3}} + \frac{23}{8}}$ seconds.

At what time does the batter hit the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{5}{4} \, \sqrt{2} + \frac{7}{4}}$ seconds.

After the ball is struck the height of the ball is modeled by the function

\[

A baseball pitcher and batter are practicing out on the field. The pitcher releases the ball at shoulder level which is ${65}$ inches. The batter hits the ball when it is at a height of ${48}$. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[
{-16 \, t^{2} + 53 \, t + 65} 
\]

At what time does the batter hit the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{8699}{3}} + \frac{53}{32}}$ seconds.

After the ball is struck the height of the ball is modeled by the function

\[
{-16 \, t^{2} + 40 \, t + 48}
\]

When does the ball hit the ground (after the batter strikes it)? $t = \answer[tolerance=0.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{3065} + \frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{\frac{8699}{3}} + \frac{53}{16}}$ seconds.
