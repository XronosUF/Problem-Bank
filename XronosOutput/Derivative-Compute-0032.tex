\begin{problem}

A swing consists of a board at the end of a ${5}$ ${\text{\texttt{meters}}}$ long rope.  Think of the board as a point $P$ at the end of the rope, and let $Q$ be the point of attachment at the other end.  Suppose that the swing is directly below $Q$ at time $t=0$, and is being pushed by someone who walks at ${3}$ ${\text{\texttt{meters}}}$ per second from left to right.  What is the angular speed of the rope in rad/s after 1 sec? \\[0.5in]

\input{Derivative-Compute-0032.HELP.tex}

The angular speed of the rope is $\answer{\frac{3}{4}}$ rad/s.
