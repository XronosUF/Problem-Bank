\input{Derivative-Compute-0066.HELP.tex}
A baseball pitcher is practicing out on the field with a partner. He releases the ball at shoulder level which is ${60}$ inches and his partner catches the ball at the height of ${63}$ inches. The height of the ball as it passes through the air can be modeled by;
\[
{-16 \, t^{2} + 61 \, t + 60} 
\]

At what time does the partner catch the ball? $t = \answer[tolerance=.2]{\frac{1}{32} \, \sqrt{3705} + \frac{61}{32}}$ seconds.
